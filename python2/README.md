**Python API Experiments - reddit.py**

This folder contains some of my experiments with accessing API's and manipulating the returned data via Python.

For my safety, all secret API keys and other personal info are imported from a local only config file to avoid compromising secret keys.

*Purpose*:
reddit.py is unfinished/irrelevant. It's original intention was the create automatic alerts for specific items showing up in the now-defuct /hardwareswap forum on reddit.
