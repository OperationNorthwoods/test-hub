**PYTHON OOP Card Games**

This folder is my constly evolving experiment with OOP concepts in Python. 

Currently, I am creating a BlackJack game with a single file. This file imports the modular and game-agnostic files card.py, deck.py, and player.py. 

This modular approach will allow me to gain experience with fundamental OOP concepts, like inheritance (which I find especially difficult). It will also allow me to create future games, like Poker, with a single file.
